Settings file located at: ~/.lumina/settings/LuminaDE/desktopsettings.conf
This file will pretty much be empty initially, except for the current background set to "default"


Example Code:
QSettings *settings = new QSettings(<file>);
settings->setValue(<variable>,<value>); //to set a value
value = settings->value(<variable>, <default value>); //to read the current value

Current Variable/Value combinations for the Lumina Desktop

===DESKTOP SETTINGS===
Prefix: "desktop-<number>" (so the first screen is "desktop-0")

--- Background settings ---
Prefix/background/current -> (QString) filepath for current background image (do not modify - handled internally)
   === Note: a background filepath of "default" corresponds to "/usr/local/share/Lumina-DE/desktop-background.jpg" internally
Prefix/background/filelist -> (QStringList) list of filepaths to use for backgrounds
Prefix/background/minutesToChange -> (Integer) Number of minutes between background changes (ignored for single image)
   === Note: Default minutes setting is 5, but you can change that if you want in this tool
   
--- Panel Settings ---
Prefix/panels -> (Integer) Number of panels to create on this screen (0->2 only)

--- Desktop Plugins ---
Prefix/pluginlist -> (QStringList) List of different plugins in use on this screen
   
==== PANEL SETTINGS ====
Prefix: "panel<screen number>.<panel number>"

defaultpanel -> (QString) <screen number>.<panel number> (0.0 by default, might be removing this later, most used for testing at the moment)
Prefix/location -> (QString) "top" or "bottom" (where to place the panel, should not have 2 panels with the same location on the same screen)
Prefix/height -> (Integer) height in pixels for the panel
Prefix/pluginlist -> (QStringList) List of plugins to put on the panel in order of Left->Right
   
I will be adding a "Panel Color" option soon as well (some kind of rgba color code), but that is not implemented yet
